#### **Overview**  
The production planning process was thoroughly analyzed, starting from raw material procurement to the distribution of finished goods. The legacy software tool and Oracle systems were integrated into the analysis, and inefficiencies in manual workflows and system integration were identified. The project implemented automation solutions, streamlined workflows, and proposed advanced forecasting techniques to improve accuracy and decision-making.  

#### **Key Features**  
1. **Automated Report Generation**: Introduction of Excel macros for automated Stock Needed Reports, reducing manual efforts and errors.  
2. **Real-Time Dashboards**: Recommended dashboards for visibility into inventory levels, production schedules, and demand forecasting.  
3. **Work Order Optimization**: Transitioned the work order creation process from dual systems to Oracle for consistency and efficiency.  
4. **Integration Improvements**: Proposed middleware for seamless data synchronization between legacy systems and Oracle.  
5. **Standardization**: Introduced dropdown options for comments in Oracle to enhance communication consistency.  
6. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Fostered cross-departmental collaboration, including interactions with the Continuous Improvement Leader and Director of Operations.
